# BPNN_Self
Self developed python code to test the Behler-Parrinello (BP) symmetry functions of BPNN. This repository contains the following files:

1) bpnn_practice.py
2) utils.py
3) input.dat
4) coords.png

The input.dat contains the coordinates of the atoms in 3D space and the coords.png is the visual representaion of those positions. The utils.py contains the different classes and functions required for the BPNN. Finally, bpnn_practice.py, the main prorgram, trains the system and showcases the difference between ordinary feed-forward neural networks and BPNN when it comes to capturing similar environments.
